# Guide to configure Git
In this section, weâ€™ll walk through the simple steps of setting up Git after installation, so you can start using it for version control.  
Weâ€™ll focus on configuring two main aspects:
1. Your name and
2. Your email

## Prerequisites - 
Before we get started, ensure Git is installed on your system. If you havenâ€™t installed Git yet, follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
Refer - [installing-git.md](https://github.com/Simrank10/git-and-github/blob/4dce466a4d39feb246b14629b2d8308803dd2ef1/2.installing-git.md)

## Git configuration steps 
* Step 1: Verify Git installation -
  Open your terminal (or Git Bash on Windows) and check if Git is installed with the following command:
  ```python
  git --version
  ```
  If the version number appears, Git is installed correctly.

* Step 2: Configure Git -
  Once Git is installed, the next step is to configure Git with your personal information. To do this, you'll need to set two things:
  1. Your name
  2. Your email
  
  Then, run the following commands to configure your name and email:
  ```python
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  git config --global user.email "Your Email"
  ```
  Note: Replace "Your Name" and "Your Email" with the details you'd like to use.

* Step 3: Verify your configuration -
  After configuring your name and email, you can verify your settings using the following commands:
  1. To check the username:
  ```python
  git config user.name
  ```
  2. To check the email:
  ```python
  git config user.email
  ```

  If no email is configured yet, it will return nothing.

* Step 4: Why the Email matters?
  Your email address is used to associate commits with your user account on Git hosting platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. Make sure the email address you use here matches the one youâ€™ll use for these platforms. This helps link your commits to your online Git profile.

* Step 5: Understanding the ```--global``` flag
  The ```--global``` flag ensures that the username and email you configure apply to all the repositories you create on this system. You donâ€™t need to configure it for every new repository. These settings are applied globally by default.

## Conclusion
Congratulations!  
Youâ€™ve successfully configured Git with your name and email.  
While Git offers additional configuration options, these are the two most important settings to get started with using Git.  
You're now ready to dive into using Git for version control!!! ðŸ¥³ðŸ’ª
