# What is Repository on GitHub?

A repository, or repo (you can call it anything—it’s the same thing), simply refers to a location where data is stored and managed.  
So, the meaning of a repository is just where your codebase is located.  
For example, let’s say there’s a folder that contains your code... any type of code, files, or data. That’s simply a repository!! (It’s nothing complicated, right?)  

Similarly, **what is a Git repository?**   
A Git repository is a repository that is managed by Git, means Git will help in version control, it'll track the changes made to your files and allows you to manage and collaborate on your project more effectively.

## Types of Repositories -

* Local Repository: This is where your code is stored on your own machine. Changes made here are not visible to others unless shared through a remote repository.

* Remote Repository: A repository hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. Remote repositories allow collaboration, where multiple people can work on the same project by accessing the repository on the cloud.
